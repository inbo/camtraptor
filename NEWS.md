# camtraptor 1.0.0

This is a major new release with a number of breaking changes. 

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Add new functions: `deployments()`, `observations()` and `media()` that make it easier to retreive the tables of the same name from a camtrap dp object. (#232)
