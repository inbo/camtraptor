get_custom_effort(

}
\arguments{
\item{package}{Camera trap data package object, as returned by
\code{read_camtrap_dp()}.}

\item{...}{filter predicates}

\item{start}{Start date.
Default: \code{NULL}.
If \code{NULL} the earliest start date among all deployments is used.
If \code{group_by} unit is not \code{NULL}, the lowest start value allowed is one
group by unit before the start date of the earliest deployment.
If this condition doesn't hold true, a warning is returned and the earliest
start date among all deployments is used.
If \code{group_by} unit is \code{NULL} the start must be later than or equal to the
start date among all deployments.}

\item{end}{End date.
Default: \code{NULL}.
If \code{NULL} the latest end date among all deployments is used.
If \code{group_by} unit is not \code{NULL}, the latest end value allowed is one group
by unit after the end date of the latest deployment.
If this condition doesn't hold true, a warning is returned and the latest
end date among all deployments is used.
If \code{group_by} unit is \code{NULL} the end must be earlier than or equal to the
end date among all deployments.}

\item{group_by}{Character, one of \code{"day"}, \code{"week"}, \code{"month"}, \code{"year"}.
The effort is calculated at the interval rate defined in \code{group_by}.
Default: \code{NULL}: no grouping, i.e. the entire interval from \code{start} to
\code{end} is taken into account as a whole. Calendar values are used, i.e.
grouping by year will calculate the effort from Jan 1st up to Dec 31st for
each year.}

\item{unit}{Character, the time unit to use while returning custom effort.
One of: \code{hour} (default), \code{day}.}

\item{datapkg}{Deprecated.
Use \code{package} instead.}
}
\value{
A tibble data frame with following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{begin}: Begin date of the interval the effort is calculated over.
\item \code{effort}: The effort as number.
\item \code{unit}: Character specifying the effort unit.
}
}
\description{
Gets the custom effort (deployment duration) for a custom time window and a
specific time interval such as day, week, month or year. The custom effort is also
calculated over all deployments, although filtering predicates can be applied
as well. This function calls \code{get_cam_op()} internally.
}
\examples{
# A global effort over the entire duration of the project (datapackage)
# measured in hours
get_custom_effort(mica)

# Global effort expressed in days
get_custom_effort(mica, unit = "day")

# Total effort from a specific start to a specific end
get_custom_effort(
  mica,
  start = as.Date("2019-12-15"), # or lubridate::as_date("2019-12-15")
  end = as.Date("2021-01-10")
)

# Effort at daily interval
get_custom_effort(
  mica,
  group_by = "day"
)

# Effort at weekly interval
get_custom_effort(
  mica,
  group_by = "week"
)

# Effort at monthly interval
get_custom_effort(
  mica,
  group_by = "month"
)

# Effort at yearly interval
get_custom_effort(
  mica,
  group_by = "year"
)

# Applying filter(s), e.g. deployments with latitude >= 51.18
get_custom_effort(mica, pred_gte("latitude", 51.18))
